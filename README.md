Witness the filthy presses
==========================

Just a RGB LED that flashes the filthy pressers obtained flair in real time.

[Watch the video demo](https://vimeo.com/126062025)

The LED is connected to an arduino pulse-width-modulation digital outputs.

The program listens to [/r/thebutton](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/) web socket and flashes the LED via [firmata](https://github.com/firmata/protocol).

My first program written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/).
